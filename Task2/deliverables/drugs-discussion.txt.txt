Redo steps 6, 10 times for each model and append the average accuracy, average macro-average F1, average weighted-average F1 as well as the standard deviation for the accuracy, the standard deviation
of the macro-average F1, and the standard deviation of the weighted-average F1 at the end of the file
drugs-performance.txt. Does the same model give you the same performance every time? Explain in a
plain text file called drugs-discussion.txt. A 1 or 2 paragraph discussion is expected.

The results of step 8 reveal that the same model will yield the same results every single time, with the exception of the 'High Performance MLP' classifier.
For all but the 'High Performance MLP' classifier this level of consistency is to be expected as all of the variables remain unchanged.
That is: the alogorithm, training set, test set and number of classes remain the same throughout every iteration. 
The lack of variation in the order of instances as well as the parameter of the algorithm guarantee that for n iterations of such a test the results will ALWAYS be identical.
This is NOT true for the 'High Performance MLP' classifier as this classifier has several hyperparameter possibilities which cause the output results to fluctuate slightly.
Looking at the standard deviations of the metrics for this algorithm we see a very small deviation (at most 6.03%) from which we can still conclude that the algorithm is fairly consistent.
